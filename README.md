# WS2812-LED-Breathing-effect

This project demonstrates how to create a breathing light effect using WS2812B LEDs with an Arduino. The project uses the FastLED library for LED control.

## Components Used
- Arduino board (e.g., Uno, Mega)
- WS2812B LED strip
- Breadboard and jumper wires

## Software Requirements
- Arduino IDE
- FastLED library

## Connections
- **LED Strip:**
  - Data pin to digital pin 7 (or change as needed)
  - VCC to 5V (or suitable voltage for your LED strip)
  - GND to GND

## Installation
1. Install the Arduino IDE from [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
2. Install the FastLED library:
   - Open the Arduino IDE.
   - Go to `Sketch` -> `Include Library` -> `Manage Libraries...`.
   - Search for `FastLED` and install it.
